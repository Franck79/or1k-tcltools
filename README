Welcome to or1k-tcltools !
==========================

1) Introduction
---------------

or1k-tcltools provides a series of Tcl scripts working together with the
OpenRISC processor used on Altera platforms using the Virtual JTAP TAP and
the Advanced Debug Interface.

The Quartus II graphical user interface provides the Tcl Console, which allows
you to control the Quartus II software with Tcl commands and scripts. Each of
the Quartus II executables— quartus_sh, quartus_map, quartus_fit, quartus_sta,
and others— also functions as a Tcl interpreter.

Depending on wich executable is used, different packages are loaded into memory.
The JTAG package is only available with quartus_stp.

The JTAG package provides a set of Tcl functions for controlling the JTAG chain
using Altera programming hardware:

	close_device
	device_dr_shift
	device_ir_shift
	device_lock
	device_run_test_idle
	device_unlock
	device_virtual_dr_shift
	device_virtual_ir_shift
	get_device_names
	get_hardware_names
	open_device

Thus, the Virutal JTAG instance controlling our Advanced Debug Interface can be
controled from the Tcl script.

2) Provided files
-----------------

defines.tcl        --> Defines for debug interface controled
functions.tcl      --> Helper functions
loader.tcl         --> Low level control of the JTAG / debug interfaces
download.tcl       --> Download and run ELF executables (or1krun function)
or1k-download.bat  --> Start or1krun from a Windows command line
run.tcl            --> Startup script used by the or1k-download.bat file

3) Usage
--------

* From a Windows/Linux command shell:

or1k-download "yourfile.elf"

* From a Tcl console:

source download.tcl
or1krun "yourfile.elf"

Using the Tcl console you also have access to the "registers" command. This
command shows you the registers values.
